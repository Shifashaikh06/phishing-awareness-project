Phishing Awareness Simulation Using Social Engineering Techniques

This project is a cybersecurity awareness simulation that demonstrates how phishing attacks work. A fake phishing email and login page were created using Google Forms to analyze user behavior and awareness.
Participants were asked to verify account details through a simulated link. Responses were recorded to measure how many users clicked the link and entered credentials.
The project highlights the importance of cybersecurity awareness and preventive measures against phishing attacks.
